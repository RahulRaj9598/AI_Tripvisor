This is *critical* for programmatic use.

Each activity includes:\n    * `placeName`: The name of the place.\n    * `placeDetails`: A description of the place and helpful tips.\n    * `placeImageUrl`: A URL to an image of the place.\n    * `geoCoordinates`: Latitude and longitude for easy mapping.\n    * `ticketPricing`: Estimated cost (crucially noting \"free\" when applicable).\n    * `travelTime`:  An estimate of travel time *between* locations, and importantly, *how* to get there (bus, rideshare, walk).\n* **Realistic Activities:** The itinerary focuses on free or low-cost activities, such as walking the Strip, visiting free attractions, and exploring Fremont Street.\n* **Transportation Advice:**  The plan includes advice on using the bus system or rideshares to save money on transportation.\n* **Important Notes:** Includes essential tips on budgeting, staying safe, and dealing with the Las Vegas climate.\n* **Error Handling (Implicit):** The `placeImageUrl` is set to `null` for the \"Departure\" activity as there's no specific image to associate with it. This prevents errors when trying to access the URL.\n* **Clear Instructions:** Each sections has clear instruction on where to find stuff to see, etc.\n\nThis comprehensive JSON output provides a solid foundation for building a travel application or website. Remember to verify prices and availability before booking anything.  Also, replace image URLs with your own if needed, as external links can break.  You can fetch this JSON directly into your application.\n"},
